Initial spread of tasks were by steps in the EM algorithm (GitHub usernames):

Initialise - @ekuginyte 
Expectation - @TYHan20
Maximisation - @holzerz
Testing Convergence - @man918

These tasks were mostly completed by the team member assigned to them

Report - @man918, @TYHan20
Design file (pseudo code) - @TYHan20, @ekuginyte

Since @TYHan20 couldn't access the team's repository for some time, the commits were made
for her by teammates.

We have all physically met multiple times:
split the workload and worked on the pseudo-code 12/10, 
continued working together from the library 15/10,
created the rest of the files 22/10,
fixed the loop issues, finished the report 27/10.

Loads of commits were made by all of the teammates, which can be seen in the history of 
the teamEM.r
