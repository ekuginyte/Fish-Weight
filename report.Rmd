# Introduction

  The data received for this project is a data frame of 1000 observations of fish with 3 types of information: ID (FishID), length of the fish (Length), and the age group they belong to (Age). 100 of the observations have been determined to belong to a known age group - 1, 2, or 3. The age group of the other 900 observations are unknown. The following are some examples of observations in FishLengths.RData and the histogram of all fish lengths.
  
  

```{r, example data from FishLengths.RData, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
library(knitr)
kable(data[4:9, ], caption = "First few rows from the original data frame")
```

  Since the age of a fish and its length are correlated, it is a reasonable approach to determine the age groups of fish populations by analyzing the distribution of their lengths.

```{r, Original histogram, echo = FALSE}
original_hist <- ggplot(data) +
  geom_density(aes(x = Length)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Length), bins = 40) +
  xlab("Fish Length (cm)") + ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Original Fish Length Data Distribution") + 
  theme_minimal()
original_hist
```


  The histogram above presents 3 peaks among all fish lengths, indicating that there could be 3 main length groups and three corresponding age groups within the 1000 observations. The assumptions was that lengths within each group are normally distributed and adopt a Gaussian mixture model for the data. The research question of this project is to find estimates of the mean (mu) and standard deviation (sigma) of the normal distributions of the 3 age groups and the probability (lambda) for a fish to be in each of the groups.



# Implementation of EM algorithm

  The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm was applied in order to find the most probable distribution of the age groups.^[This sentence will be printed as a footnote.] The first step is to assign the fish of unknown age into one of the age groups based on their length and the estimated parameters of the normal distributions for each age group. As a start, data from fish of known age groups are used to compute mu, sigma, and lambda for the 3 age groups. In the following iterations, estimates from the previous iterations are used. The second step is to calculate the posterior probability of a fish belonging to each age group given the observation of its length. The third step is to make new estimates of mu, sigma, and lambda based on the posterior probabilities. In the final step, a log-likelihood is calculated using the new estimates. Convergence is tested by comparing the log-likelihood of the current iteration and the previous. If the difference is smaller than a desired tolerance value, which is typically small, then convergence is met. These are the main components in a single iteration of the EM algorithm. The four steps will keep repeating until either convergence is met or reaches a maximum of iterations.

age group to the ones that were assigned by the initialise() function.

## Simulation from Gaussian Mixture

As part of the testing of the fishEM function, the data was simulated from a known Gaussian mixture, implemented the fishEM function on this data and compared the estimates with the known results. 
The simulation testing function (found in file ‘Simulation_Testing.R’) takes distribution inputs from the user, creates the simulated Gaussian mixture, runs the ‘fishEM’ function on this data and evaluates the accuracy of the estimates via confidence intervals.
In order to obtain the simulated data, the function samples 1000 values from 3 different Normal distributions with means and standard deviations sourced from the inputs of the ‘simulation’ function. For the testing, means of 20, 40, 70 and standard deviations of 2, 5, 10 were used respectively. In the simulation data, 100 of the values will have known ‘Age’ data; the rest (900) of the ‘Age’ values will be ‘NA’. 



```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Simulation testing of the fishEM function

# This function is a testing function that will take distribution inputs from
# the user, create the simulated Gaussian mixture, run the fishEM function on 
# this data and evaluate the accuracy of the estimates

#          means - a vector of length 3 with the true means

  # round(ci_upper[3], 2), ")"))

```



The simulated data has 3 distinct peaks (much like the FishLengths.RData file) with each peak having a different standard deviation. The next step was running the fishEM function on the simulated data which had the following outputs:

simulation(data, means = c(20, 40, 70), sds = c(2, 5, 10))

[1] "No of iterations is  78"
[1] "The values for the gaussian mixture are mu = 20 , 40 , 70 with sd = 2, 5, 10. The EM algorithm produced means of mu = 22.19 , 41 , 66.82 . Hence, the confidence intervals for the means are ( 20.56 , 23.81 ) , ( 36.19 , 45.81 ) , ( 51.37 , 82.28 )"

The user will be able to use this to evaluate if the true means lie in the confidence intervals. 
Please note: since the seed has not been set in this function, the estimates do change on every re-run. In this testing example, the ‘fishEM’  function took 78 iterations to converge to the means with a system time of 0.68 seconds.

The results obtained from the estimates table show the estimated mean and standard deviation of the length of fish contained in each age group of fish, Age 1, Age 2 and Age 3. This means the EM algorithm calculated that the average length of fish in age group 1 was 23.11, in age group 2 was 41.81 and age group 3 was 66.86. These results are in line with the distribution of known fish lengths and therefore are a sensible set of estimates. 


## Plot

The plot show how the model fits to the original data. The three distribution curves follow the histogram trend, the fishEM algorithm works effectively.
