## Pseudo code for function fishEM
Inputs:
  data - data frame with N observations and 3 columns: FishID, Length, Age (k numbered groups for known, and NA for
                                                                            unknown).
epsilon - desired tolerance value for convergence.
maxit - maximum number of iterations.
Outputs:
  inits - dataframe with mu, sigma, lambda for k age groups.
posterior - posterior probabilities of N observations in k age groups.
estimates - new mu, sigma, lambda for k age groups.
converged - TRUE if convergence is met before the maximum iteration, FALSE otherwise.
likelihood - vector of length equals to number of iterations, maximum
length equals to maxit.
fishEM <- function(data, epsilon = 1e-08, maxit = 1000) {
  1. Initialisation
  Assign labels to fish with latent age variables based on data from fish
  with known age:
    Take the the values of the probability density functions for each fish length, compare them, and assign the age groups
  in
  accordance with the highest pdf value.
  Take the data with the known and assigned values and calculate mean (mu), sd (sigma) for each age group.
  Calculate probability (lambda) for a fish to be in each age group.
  Repeating expectation, maximization and testing of convergence.
  Create a for-loop with maximum iterations of maxit times. for (i in 1:maxit) {
    2. Expectation
    Calculate probabilities for fish belonging to each age group given the observed lengths.  Use inits as a start and then use estimates from previous iterations
    3. Maximization
    Calculate new estimates for mean, sd, and probability for each age group based on the posterior probabilities.
    4. Testing Convergence
    Calculate the log-likelihood with parameters of this iteration.
    If the difference between log-likelihood of this iteration and the previous is smaller than tolerance value, then
    convergence is met.
    Break the for-loop if convergent
    if (log(ith likelihood) - log((i-1)th likelihood) < epsilon)
      break.
    If not convergent, reassign Age groups to latent variables in the dataframe the same way it has been done at the
    Initialisation step.
    Go back to the E step. Maximum amount of iterations - maxit.
